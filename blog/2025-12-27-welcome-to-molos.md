# Welcome to MoLOS

This is the first post on the MoLOS blog. Like many development tools, I’ll be using this space to explain why I started building MoLOS, share the roadmap, and discuss the vision behind the project.

### Whoami
First of all: **hi! I’m Edu.** I'm a CS grad working full-time as a DevOps engineer. I enjoy programming, playing the guitar, and eating Barilla pasta. But above all else, what I love most is **building tools.**

I’ve built plenty of things over the years: 
* An **ESP32 portable roulette simulator**.
* An **AI persona** that gained 200+ followers on Substack (she was a divorced mother of two who moved to Spain—long story).
* Various **functional 3D prints** for family and friends. 

All of these projects shared a common frustration: I had to use third-party tools, hosted on third-party servers, in third-party countries, with third-party cookies... and probably third-party dogs. 

**I didn't like that. At all.**

### So this is because I hate freedom

I also have a specific beef with the "infinite freedom" of platforms like Notion. 

> "It’s great to have an open field to run in, but if you don't build a road, only a few people will ever find their way through it."  __Edu__

That excess of freedom is exactly why I started building this. MoLOS offers the freedom to build what you want and a database to store what you need, but with **"fences"**, logical structures that keep your data functional instead of messy.

### Roadmap
There isn't a rigid roadmap just yet, but my vision is clear: **For every popular paid or subscription-based SaaS, I want to create a free MoLOS module.**

| What’s Feasible | What’s NOT |
| :--- | :--- |
| CharacterAI-style modules | A MoLOS Netflix |
| Gym assistant modules | MoLOS OpenAI |
| Personalized productivity tools | Bitcoin MoLOS |

### Get Involved
If you have any questions, suggestions, ideas, or just some free time to chat, I’m happy to hear from you. 

**Start exploring MoLOS and have fun! :)**

**Edu**
