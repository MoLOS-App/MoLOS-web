# The Architect

Ever had five apps open and still no clue what to do next? The Architect is the one seat in the control room that makes your modules talk so you can actually move. It is the central point where tasks, goals, finance, health, and everything else meet and play nice.

:::info
The Architect does not replace your modules. It connects them so answers are based on your actual data, not guesses.
:::

## What it does

- Turns scattered data into a next step you can act on.
- Connects module outcomes so you see the whole story, not five mini-stories.
- Keeps it personal by using tools scoped to your user, not everyone’s.

## How it does it

Modules can optionally expose AI tools. When they do, The Architect can call them and stitch the results into one answer. No tools, no magic. Tools are the contract.

If a module exists, The Architect can use it. If it does not, build it and the conversation widens.

:::tip
Ask questions that include a goal, a time window, or a constraint. The Architect loves clear boundaries.

## Quick prompts (copy/paste)

- "Give me the smallest plan that still hits my goal by Friday."
- "What is blocking my progress, and what is the next thing I should do?"
- "Compare this week to last week and tell me where I drifted."
- "If I can only do 30 minutes today, what is the best move?"
- "Turn this into tasks and add a simple timeline."

## Module cheat sheet

| Module    | What it brings                     |
| --------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Tasks     | Action steps, projects, deadlines  |
| Goals     | Targets, milestones, timelines     |
| Health    | Workouts, trends, recovery signals |
| Meals     | Nutrition context, intake patterns |
| Notes     | Friction, ideas, quick context     |
| Calendar  | Time reality, gaps, conflicts      |
| Dashboard | Trends, snapshots, reality checks  |

:::note
Every answer can lead to action. The Architect can propose tasks, timelines, or a quick dashboard view and ask if you want it created.

## Why it matters

MoLOS is modular by design. The Architect is the glue that makes the modularity feel like one system instead of a bunch of apps sitting next to each other.
